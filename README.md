# CurrencyDetection
Visually impaired people have a difficult time distinguishing between different cash denominations. Even though unique symbols are engraved on different denominations in India, the work is still difficult for blind individuals. The shortage of identification devices prompted the development of a handheld system for denominational recognition. This project is based on the Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithm. The ORB uses the FAST detector and the BRIEF visual description (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features). Its goal is to provide an alternative to Local Scale Invariant Features that is both quick and efficient (SIFT). On a given currency paper input image, several pre-processing actions are conducted first. Then, from the backdrop, the most important ROI is extracted. The ORB Algorithm is used to recognize and describe features in the input image. Finally, Hamming Distance is used for comparing binary descriptors obtained during the feature extraction stage. If the difference is smaller than a certain threshold, the currency's numeric portion is extracted and compared. If they're the same, the corresponding monetary denomination is recognized. Indian money denominations such as 10, 20, 50, 100, 500 and 2000 are accepted.
